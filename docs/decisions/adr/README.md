# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) documenting significant architectural and design decisions for the Agentive Starter Kit and Clio.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. Each ADR describes:
- **Context**: The forces and factors influencing the decision
- **Decision**: What was decided and why
- **Consequences**: The positive, negative, and neutral implications

ADRs are **immutable** once accepted. If a decision changes, we create a new ADR that supersedes the old one, preserving the historical context.

## Format

We use [Michael Nygard's ADR format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). See [TEMPLATE-FOR-ADR-FILES.md](TEMPLATE-FOR-ADR-FILES.md) for the full template.

## Naming Convention

ADRs use the format **`ADR-####-description.md`** where:
- `ADR-` is the required prefix
- `####` is a four-digit sequential number
- `-description` is a short kebab-case description

**Number Ranges:**
- `0001-0099`: Foundation/infrastructure ADRs
- `1001-1099`: Agentive Starter Kit ADRs

### Superseded ADRs

None yet.

## Process

### Creating a New ADR

1. **Identify the decision**: Is this an architectural decision that affects the project's structure, behavior, or future direction?

2. **Assign a number**: Use the next sequential number in the appropriate range

3. **Draft the ADR**: Use the [template](TEMPLATE-FOR-ADR-FILES.md), focusing on:
   - **Context**: What forces led to this decision?
   - **Decision**: What was decided and why?
   - **Consequences**: What are the trade-offs?

4. **Review**: Get feedback from project stakeholders

5. **Accept**: Mark status as "Accepted" and update this index

6. **Commit**: Include the ADR in your commit

### Superseding an ADR

When a decision changes:

1. **Create a new ADR** documenting the new decision
2. **Update the old ADR**: Change status to "Superseded by ADR-XXXX"
3. **Update this index**: Move the old ADR to "Superseded" section
4. **Preserve history**: Never delete or significantly modify accepted ADRs

## When to Write an ADR

**Write an ADR when:**
- Making architectural choices that affect project structure
- Choosing between competing technical approaches
- Establishing patterns or conventions
- Making trade-offs with significant implications
- Decisions that future developers will need to understand

**Don't write an ADR for:**
- Routine bug fixes
- Feature implementations following established patterns
- Temporary experimental code
- Configuration changes without architectural impact

## ADR Priority Levels

- **HIGH**: Core architecture, must understand to work on project
- **MEDIUM**: Important patterns, helpful for most development
- **LOW**: Specific features, reference as needed
