// AppState.swift
// AudioRecordingManager
//
// App-level state persisted as `state/app.json` inside the ARM data root.
// Currently holds the migration marker so the one-shot legacy-Desktop
// migration only runs once. Future phases will add project configuration
// (Teams destination, etc.) here.
//
// Reads and writes go through atomic temp-file-then-rename to avoid corrupt
// state if the app is killed mid-write.
