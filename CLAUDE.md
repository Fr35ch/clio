# CLAUDE.md

This file gives future Claude sessions the context they need to be useful on this project without re-deriving it each time.

## Project at a glance

**Audio Recording Manager (ARM)** — a macOS SwiftUI app for NAV (Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration) researchers. Records user interviews, transcribes them (local NB-Whisper), optionally anonymizes and analyses, and uploads the results to Microsoft Teams/SharePoint.

- **Language/stack:** Swift 5.9+, SwiftUI, AVFoundation. Xcode project (`AudioRecordingManager.xcodeproj`) with a Swift Package manifest (`Package.swift`) for ergonomics. Python helpers for transcription / anonymization / LLM work are invoked via `Process`.
- **Target:** macOS 14 Sonoma minimum, Apple Silicon, 16 GB RAM, 30 GB disk.
- **UI language:** Norwegian (Bokmål). User-facing copy should be Norwegian unless otherwise specified.
- **Design system:** Liquid Glass (native macOS materials). See ADR-1007 (NAV Aksel was superseded). Use `AppColors`, `AppSpacing`, `AppRadius` — not NAVColors/NAVSpacing.
- **Versioning:** SemVer, tracked in `VERSION`, `Info.plist`, and `CHANGELOG.md`. Current: see `VERSION`. Release script at `scripts/release.sh`. Full guide in [docs/VERSIONING.md](docs/VERSIONING.md).

## Who the users are and why it matters

Researchers interviewing NAV service recipients and employees. Interview content is **highly sensitive personal data**. The product is installed on **researchers' own NAV-issued machines**. This drives most architectural decisions:

- Files live under `~/Library/Application Support/AudioRecordingManager/` — excluded from roaming profile sync via MDM, never on the Desktop
- Local recordings are **automatically deleted after 30 days** from creation, with warnings at day 23 and day 29
- Anonymization runs inside ARM (AnonymizationSectionView in the transcript editor) before upload
- Data uploads to **backup-excluded private Teams channels** per the NAV routine for temporary storage of insight data (ref. PVK 25/35628)
- Teams enforces 8-month automatic deletion; ARM surfaces this retention window prominently but does not enforce it locally

## Current architectural state (as of 2026-04-14)

### File storage — mid-pivot, documented in ADR-1014

**Today's code** still stores files on the Desktop at `~/Desktop/lydfiler/` (audio) and `~/Desktop/tekstfiler/` (transcripts), linked by filename stem. The audit log is a hidden dotfile inside the audio folder.

**Target (Phase 0, planned)** moves all data to `~/Library/Application Support/AudioRecordingManager/` with UUID-named per-recording folders containing audio + transcript + metadata sidecar. MDM excludes this path from roaming profile sync. Egress moves from manual-drag-into-Teams to direct Graph API upload (Phase 1). Local files are automatically deleted after 30 days.

If you are asked to add features that interact with file storage, **check which world the task belongs to**:

- If the code you're touching still uses `~/Desktop/lydfiler/`, the pivot hasn't landed yet — work within the old layout and minimise new coupling so the pivot stays tractable.
- If the code is under `Sources/AudioRecordingManager/Storage/` (new), the pivot has begun — use `RecordingStore` APIs, not direct path construction.
- Do not add new code paths that write to Desktop. The Desktop is being eliminated as a storage location.

Key documents for file management:
- [ADR-1014](docs/decisions/adr/ADR-1014-file-storage-architecture-pivot.md) — the decision
- [docs/FILE_MANAGEMENT_AND_TEAMS_SYNC.md](docs/FILE_MANAGEMENT_AND_TEAMS_SYNC.md) — the spec
- [docs/prd/file-management-teams-sync/USER_STORIES.md](docs/prd/file-management-teams-sync/USER_STORIES.md) — the stories
- [docs/prd/file-management-teams-sync/PHASE_0_TASKS.md](docs/prd/file-management-teams-sync/PHASE_0_TASKS.md) — the build-order task list

## Codebase orientation

All Swift sources live under `Sources/AudioRecordingManager/`. The file `main.swift` is very large and contains much of the app; it is being incrementally broken up. Other notable files:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.swift` | App entry, `AudioRecorder`, `AudioFileManager`, `RecordingsManager`, main UI views, settings, etc. (large — expect to read chunks, not whole) |
| `AudioLevelVisualization.swift` | Scrolling waveform drawn with `Canvas`. Right-anchored, buffer capped at 1000 entries (50 s at 20 Hz). Source of truth for visualization is `AVAudioRecorder` metering at 20 Hz. |
| `TranscriptionService.swift` | Invokes Python NB-Whisper bridge via `Process`. |
| `TranscriptManager.swift` | Surfaces `RecordingStore` transcripts as `[TranscriptItem]`. |
| `AnonymizationService.swift` | Invokes `no-anonymizer` Python library. |
| `AuditLogger.swift` | Append-only JSONL audit log under `~/Library/Application Support/AudioRecordingManager/audit/`. |
| `Startup/*` | Splash screen, hardware checks, dependency verification. |
| `Storage/*` | Phase 0 storage layer: `RecordingStore`, `StorageLayout`, metadata sidecars, migration from legacy Desktop folders. |
| `Design/*` | **Protected design surface** — colours, spacing, radii, button styles, window chrome reference. See `Design/README.md` before editing. |
| `RecordingDetailView.swift`, `TranscriptsView.swift`, `MainView.swift`, etc. | UI. |

## Design surface — protected boundary

`Sources/AudioRecordingManager/Design/` is the single source of truth for visual style:

- `DesignTokens.swift` — `AppColors`, `AppSpacing`, `AppRadius`
- `GlassStyles.swift` — `GlassButtonStyle`, `HoverButtonStyle`, `glassEffectIfAvailable`
- `WindowChrome.swift` — canonical window chrome shape (documentation) + `TabContentChrome` + `WindowSize`
- `README.md` — rules and rationale

**Rules for future Claude sessions:**

1. **Do not "fix" layout by editing `Design/`.** If the app looks off, the problem is almost always a callsite using the wrong token, or a tab missing a chrome hook — not a design token being wrong. Start at the callsite.
2. **Never hardcode a colour, spacing, or corner radius outside `Design/`.** Use the tokens.
3. **Never add these chrome workarounds outside `Design/`** (they historically fought the canonical chrome):
   - `.ignoresSafeArea(edges: .top)` on the main view tree
   - `Spacer().frame(height: 52)` as a manual title-bar inset
   - `.toolbarBackground(.hidden, for: .windowToolbar)`
   - `.navigationTitle("")` added solely to suppress chrome
   - Direct `NSWindow` manipulation (`titlebarAppearsTransparent`, `fullSizeContentView`, `titleVisibility`, `styleMask`) in `AppDelegate`
4. **`VirginProjectApp.body` chrome modifiers and `Design/WindowChrome.swift` must stay in sync.** The `.windowStyle()` / `.windowToolbarStyle()` modifiers must live on the `Scene` (can't be packaged into a `ViewModifier`), but `WindowChrome.swift` documents their canonical shape.
5. **If a design change is genuinely needed, ask the user first.** Don't edit `Design/` speculatively.

## External dependencies and services

- **Python 3.10+** for transcription and anonymization. Not bundled; app checks on startup (`DependencyManager`).
- **no-transcribe** (Python) — NB-Whisper wrapper for Norwegian speech-to-text.
- **no-anonymizer** (Python, `[ner]` extras) — HuggingFace BERT-based NER for anonymization. SpaCy dependency was removed in 1.4.0.
- **Ollama** — local LLM runtime for analysis. Optional.
- **Microsoft Graph (Entra ID)** — planned for Phase 1 upload. Requires Azure AD app registration in NAV tenant.

## Conventions

- **File references in Markdown:** use `[filename.swift:line](path)` format for IDE clickability — the VS Code extension context requires it.
- **Norwegian in UI, English in code and comments.**
- **ADRs** go under `docs/decisions/adr/` using the template at `docs/decisions/adr/TEMPLATE-FOR-ADR-FILES.md`. Use the next available `ADR-1xxx` number.
- **PRDs / user stories** go under `docs/prd/<epic-name>/USER_STORIES.md`. One epic per folder.
- **Never write to the Desktop from new code.** Existing Desktop writes are being removed, not augmented.
- **Bus-factor documents** (ADRs, PRDs, CHANGELOG) are how this project preserves context across sessions — if you make a meaningful decision during work, record it where it belongs rather than burying it in a commit message.

## Recurring themes the project is sensitive to

1. **Compliance, not polish.** This app handles personal data belonging to vulnerable people. Correctness and auditability beat cleverness and features.
2. **The 8-month Teams retention is not decorative.** Files on the backup-excluded private channels are auto-deleted by M365 after 8 months with no recovery path. Do not design features that assume data lives indefinitely on Teams. ARM must surface this retention window clearly.
3. **Local data has a hard 30-day shelf life.** Recordings are automatically deleted 30 days after creation. There is no manual wipe flow. Do not design features that assume local files persist indefinitely.
4. **Anonymization is optional but in-scope.** It runs inside ARM via AnonymizationSectionView (transcript editor) before upload. Never make anonymization status a blocker for upload — it is the researcher's responsibility, not a gate ARM enforces.
5. **Researcher interviews haven't happened yet.** Some UX decisions are deliberately deferred until the product owner completes discovery. Check whether a task you're given depends on those answers; if so, flag it rather than inventing a design.

## When in doubt

- Read the most recent ADR first — decisions are durable there.
- Read `CHANGELOG.md` for the last one or two minor versions to see what's just changed.
- Read the Phase 0 task list if touching storage or upload — those are the live workstreams.
- Ask the user to clarify scope before starting large edits. Many tasks in this codebase have subtle compliance implications that aren't obvious from the code alone.

## Key decisions log (pointer index)

- ADR-1007: NAV Design System integration (historical — superseded by Liquid Glass migration in 1.4.0)
- ADR-1014: File storage architecture pivot (this is the big one — read it)

*ADR-1006 (network isolation / zero-trust stance) is superseded. ARM is installed on researchers' own NAV-issued machines; ARM no longer manages network state.*

## Build & run

- Xcode: `⌘B` to build, `⌘R` to run. Minimum macOS 14.
- Release script: `./scripts/release.sh <patch|minor|major>` — see [docs/VERSIONING.md](docs/VERSIONING.md).
- Python dependencies are user-installed; `DependencyManager` verifies on launch.
